                <p>Albert Einstein, born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, 
                was a theoretical physicist whose groundbreaking contributions revolutionized our understanding of the universe. 
                <br> Best known for his theory of relativity (E=mc²), Einstein's work laid the foundation for modern physics .  
                <br>His intellectual prowess and creativity extended beyond science, as he also made significant contributions to philosophy and humanitarian causes.
                 Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, Einstein's legacy endures as one of the greatest scientific minds in history. Beyond his iconic equations, his profound quotes and charismatic persona have made him a symbol of curiosity, imagination, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.
                  Einstein passed aw ay on April 18, 1955, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire and shape the scientific landscape.
